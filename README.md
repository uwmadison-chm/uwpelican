# Pelican UW-Madison theme

Original template HTML files are in `original/` and can be ignored.

To use this with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), add `-t ~/path/to/uwpelican/` or set
`THEME = '/path/to/uwpelican'` in `pelicanconf.py`.

## Supported metadata

`EMAIL` and `PHONE` will be added to footer if available in config.

`SOCIAL` tuples no longer use fancy icons like the original static theme, but 
will be linked in the footer.

## TODO

* Actual menu support
* Add a screenshot, link to a sample site
